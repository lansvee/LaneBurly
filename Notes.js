// To create a react app -> npx create-react-app <projectName>

/*
The app created from the command above will create several folders and files worth taking note:
public folder - used for adding publicly available files such as images.
src folder - the source folder containing files used in development like the index.js, index.css, App.js, App.css
index.js file - considered as the top level element for rendering all components in the app.
index.css - used as the global css file for the whole application.
App.js - serves as the main component where all other components will be loaded in.
App.css - is a css file that can be used for styling individual components for separation of concerns.
index.html is the entry point of the application where the index.js file is loaded into.
